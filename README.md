REQUIREMENTS:

1] Application : Visual studio and Browser
2] A computer with a processor that is fast enough to encode and decode the hidden message.
3] Operating System : Windows, mac, Linux

TECHNOLOGY USED:

1] Python 3.9 or above
2] OpenCV - Open Source Computer Vision Library is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. A computer vision system can detect the facial emotions and detection of eye and mouth outliners in a real time video stream and then alert the driver by prompting an alarm.
3] Dlib - Dlib is a general purpose cross platform library written in the programming language in c++. It here used in detection of the facial landmark locaions.
4] PIL - Pillow is a powerful tool for image processing. It can be used to resize, crop, rotate, and flip images. It can also be used to add text, borders, and effects to images. Pillow can also be used to convert images between different file formats.
5] Flask - Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. It is intended to be a simple, flexible and extensible framework for building web applications.

REQUIRED LIBRARIES:

numpy - 1.19.3
opencv-python - 4.6.0.66
scipy 1.7.1
re
wave
os
tempfile
fileinput

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE TEXT, IMAGE AND AUDIO STEGANOGRAPHY:

STEP 1: First, keep the all source code in same folder
STEP 2: Install Visual Studio to run the python files.
STEP 3: In Visual Studio, select File -> Open Folder which contains the python files.
STEP 4: After opening the files,check whether the required libraries are installed in the system or not.
STEP 5: If not go to visual studio terminal or command prompt to install the required python libraries.
STEP 6: In app.py,click Run -> Run without debugging to execute the program.
STEP 7: It will take you to the browser window to run the project text, image, and audio steganography.

WORKING:

Text Steganography

1] Open the text file that you want to hide the message in.
2] Create the message that you want to hide.
3] Use a steganography tool to encode the message into the text file.
4] Save the text file.
5] upload the text file to the decode.
6] The decode uses a steganography tool to extract the message from the text file.

Image Steganography

1] Open the image file that you want to hide the message in.
2] Create the message that you want to hide.
3] Use a steganography tool to encode the message into the image file.
4] Save the image file.
5] upload the image file to the decode.
6] The decode uses a steganography tool to extract the message from the image file.

Audio Steganography

1] Open the audio file that you want to hide the message in.
2] Create the message that you want to hide.
3] Use a steganography tool to embed the message into the audio file.
4] Save the audio file.
5] upload the audio file to the decode.
6] The decode uses a steganography tool to extract the message from the audio file.
